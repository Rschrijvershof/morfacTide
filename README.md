This repository hosts a matlab toolbox called morfacTide. The toolbox is developed as part of the publication Schrijvershof et al. (2023). The toolbox constructs tidal boundary signals for morphodynamic models, ensuring that the variance of the original (non-schematized) signal is preserved as much as possible. For more detailed information see the (open-access) publication below.
